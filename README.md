# BookStore-Database
Uses a local database of sql server inside visual studio with .NET and web forms

The following assignment was for my Software Enterprise class. We needed to create a grid data view that stores book information 
such as data publishes, author, book name, area published, and number of pages. Error handling is also implemented in this
application. Note that this does user a local database. 

Within the gridView you are also able to delete, insert, and edit book information. 

At the bottom users are able to filter the gridView table by selecting a specific book, a specific genre, or searching
what book are higher at a certain price that the user inputs.
